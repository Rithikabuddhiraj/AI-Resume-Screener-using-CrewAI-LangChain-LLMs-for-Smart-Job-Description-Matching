# AI Resume Screener using CrewAI, LangChain & LLMs

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an AI-driven resume screening solution designed to intelligently match candidate profiles with job descriptions. It leverages **CrewAI** for orchestrating autonomous agents, **LangChain** for language model integration, and **LLMs** for contextual understanding and evaluation. The system streamlines the candidate shortlisting process by analyzing both resumes and job requirements, outputting ranked matches with reasoning.

## 🤖 Role of Agentic AI (CrewAI)
The project employs **CrewAI**, an agentic AI framework, to simulate a collaborative evaluation process:
- **Autonomous AI Agents** are assigned specialized tasks such as skill extraction, JD analysis, and candidate scoring.
- These agents **work collaboratively**, mimicking the workflow of a human hiring team.
- With support from **LLMs**, agents demonstrate deep understanding and reasoning to make smart candidate selections.
